# Welcome to the global emission visualizer tool:
Hello User,

you can run the global_emission_visualizer tool by running the EXE file "global_emission_visualizer_CV.exe".
Thereby, you will not need to install specific python packages and you will not encounter issues with package conflicts.
Your will still need all the folders to successfully run the exe.
Alternatively, you can run the file "global_emission_visualizer_CV.py" as it is the main script.
All files to run or inspect the python code are provided in the subfolders (python files for functions and an excel file for the data).

Have fun!

Best regards,
Christian Zibunas

# Development and purpose of this tool:
**Development:**
This interactive tool was initially developed during a Python course, merging my interests in environmental data, data analysis, and programming. The project was further expanded in my spare time after successfully completing my PhD studies, in which I had already worked on data-driven sustainability assessment. In summary, developing the tool was a fun way to further train my Python skills and pursue my interests. 

**Purpose:** 
The tool's primary purpose is to provide a user-friendly interface for visualizing global greenhouse gas emissions data.

In todayâ€™s data-rich world, information is often overwhelming and underutilized. This tool addresses that challenge by transforming the vast amount of emissions data into an accessible and engaging format. By offering a world map as heatmap for GHG emissions as well as pie charts, bar plots, and line plots of historic emission, it allows users to easily explore and understand emissions data across different countries and years.

The tool serves several key purposes:
- Quick Overview: It provides a swift and intuitive way to grasp the distribution of global emissions.
- Trend Analysis: Users can switch between years or view the whole emission history in line plots to analyze trends and compare emissions across multiple countries.
- Focused Insights: Features like highlighting the major polluters and the customizability of each of each plot facilitate targeted analysis and discussions.
