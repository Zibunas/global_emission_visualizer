# global_emission_visualizer
Hello User,

you can run the global_emission_visualizer tool by running the exe file.
Thereby, you will not need to install specific python packages and you will not encounter issues with package conflicts.
Alternatively you can of course run the global_emission_visualizer_CV.py file.

Have fun!

Best regards Christian Zibunas
