# User instructions global_emission_visualizer
Hello User,

you can run the global_emission_visualizer tool by running the EXE file "global_emission_visualizer_CV.exe".
Thereby, you will not need to install specific python packages and you will not encounter issues with package conflicts.
Alternatively you can of course run the file "global_emission_visualizer_CV.py" as it is the main script.
All files (python files and a xlsx for the data) to run or inspect the code are provided in the subfolders.

Have fun!

Best regards Christian Zibunas
